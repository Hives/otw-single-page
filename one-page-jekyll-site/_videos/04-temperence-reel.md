Here's a fiddle tune from when we played at Islington Folk Club in June 2018, a version of The Temperance Reel from West Virgina fiddler Wilson Douglas.

You can check out the whole set in two parts [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8MT6QWvJJo&list=PLgt6GlmNZr17lu9u82C5Urtjp5RRR_J90) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGd5IANe6-8&list=PLgt6GlmNZr15TKT9m__MicnTX2NPXN2O0).
