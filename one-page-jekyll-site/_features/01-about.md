The Old Time Wasters play and sing American traditional old-time music and songs drawn from the dark and dusty corners of the 20s and 30s string band repertoire, with the occasional detour into English music-hall. Their often eccentric and amusing selections are complemented with rock-solid rhythm and infectious three-part harmonies.

You can book them to play at your festival, wedding, barn dance, club...
