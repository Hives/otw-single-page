The Old Time Wasters play and sing American traditional old-time music and songs, drawn from the dark and dusty corners of the 20s and 30s string band reportoire, with the occasional detour into English music-hall.

Often eccentric and amusing, balanced with morbid and depressing, with rock-solid rhythm and infectious three-part harmonies

You can book us to play at your festival, wedding, barn dance, club... we can also do workshops
